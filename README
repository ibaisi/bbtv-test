In Bbtv can be found the Symfony2 bundle with the backend code and the composer.json with the required components.

In leaderboard-cli can be found the simple angular frontend app.

Regarding the "Bonus challenge (not required): Make your implementation automatically synchronize the scores in the view for all people who have that web page open." it's been done through poling, althoug a better way for doing this would be using websockets but given the time I haven't worked with php and angular I wouldn't have finished in time.

Another improvement would be that the add points and add participant (another extra bonus :D) should be POST/PUT methods instead of GET to align with http standards.

Stylesheets missing.
